# SKGC: Semantic Knowledge-Guided Classification for Congenital Heart Disease Diagnosis

## Overview

🚀 **Introduction:** Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a critical health concern affecting healthy development and growth. SKGC, our proposed framework, leverages deep learning to provide accurate diagnosis, overcoming limitations in existing methods.

💡 **Key Features:**
- **Semantic-Level Knowledge Extraction (SKEM) 🧠:** Extracts crucial semantic knowledge from 4CH ultrasound images.
- **Multi-Knowledge Fusion (MFM) 🔄:** Integrates knowledge from semantic and original images.
- **Classification Module (CM) 🤖:** Enables flexible classification using advanced classifiers.

🎯 **Loss Function Enhancement:** SKGC introduces a novel loss function, strengthening the constraint between foreground and background predictions for improved semantic-level knowledge.

## Experimental Environment

🔧 **Platform:** Arch Linux  
💻 **Hardware:** Intel Xeon Gold 5320 CPU, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU  
🛠️ **Implementation:** PyTorch with MMPreTrain

## Results

📊 **Performance:** SKGC demonstrates remarkable accuracy, achieving peak accuracies of 99.1% and 96.5% on real-world NA-4CH and CAMUS datasets, respectively.

🌟 **Noteworthy Improvement:** Even with only 10 labeled masks, SKGC enhances accuracy from 75.9% to 88.5%.
